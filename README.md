# Satyam_FOPJava_GradedProject1

This is a Graded Coding Assignment Project where we have a Super Department and 3 other departments Admin, Hr, and Tech.

This is designed and developed under Java and OOPS Concepts of Object Classes, Inheritance, and Runtime Polymorphism, where we handle different functionalities of each department based on creation and initialization of objects and corresponding class references which decided at the time of execution or runtime.

The project is structured in an organized fashion, where we have separate packages, for superclass, subclass and main class respectively. SuperDepartment class is created inside superclass package. Similarly, we have AdminDepartment, HrDepartment and TechDepartment created under subclass package. Consequently, we have a main package with the driver class Main created inside.

The driver class Main handles all the functionalites and drives the code, displays all the functionalities for each of the departments, while taking holiday status from SuperDepartment class, which can be accessed via subclasses(AdminDepartment, HrDepartment and TechDepartment) as well because they extend SuperDepartment class

We have took care that, the code inside is completely readable, formatted, indentated and fully understandable by the user. We also documentated the code with appropriate comments placed at each piece of code, describing its functionality or usage.
